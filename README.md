LiveQuizzMbaas
==============

## A live quizz POC android app made with the help of two MBAAS Kinvey and Firebase.


This app was made for fun for an interactive presentation on MBAAS.
You can find this presentation here :
- slides in english : http://fr.slideshare.net/GuilhemDuch
- video in french : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X49o6RSnis0

To make it work you have to setup apps on :
- kinvey.com : set up an app on kinvey.com mbaas, then set up app value in kinvey.properties in assets folder of the android app.
- firebase : set up an app on firebase.com realtime mbaas and change all java references to firebase to target your new environment.


## Support
I don't plan to detail the architecture and document the code because i'm too lazy on this one ;)
Some people may find it interesting to reuse or study.
I don't  plan to provide any support neither to update it. But who knows ...
Therefore i took the time to release it as open source.
Do not hesitate to modify it, update it, or fork it.

This app uses other open source libraries :
- google http client
- gson
- guava
- butterknife
- eventbus
- action bar pull to refresh
